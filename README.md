        <h1>Deep Learning-Based Early Alzheimer’s Detection from MRI Scans</h1>
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by cognitive decline and memory loss. 
            Early diagnosis is essential for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. This project presents an AI-powered system for early 
            Alzheimer’s detection using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. The system employs a deep learning approach based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
            built on the ResNet50 architecture, pre-trained on ImageNet. 
        </p>
        <p>
            By leveraging transfer learning, the model is fine-tuned on MRI data to identify subtle structural changes in the brain associated with different stages of Alzheimer’s, 
            including Non-Demented, Very Mild Demented, Mild Demented, and Moderate Demented categories. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The model was initially trained for 2 epochs, achieving a test accuracy of <b>35.03%</b>. However, increasing the training epochs significantly improved the accuracy 
            to the range of <b>90-95%</b>. 
        </p>
